# Methodology

## Overview

This study employs computer vision (CV) techniques to assess children's physical development and coordination through structured tasks. The proposed methodology integrates action recognition, pose estimation, and temporal analysis to evaluate children's performance in specific movement-based tests. The system leverages machine learning models trained on open-source datasets to ensure accurate and reliable assessments.

## Task 1: Assessing Limb Development via Imitation

We aim to evaluate children's limb development by analyzing their ability to mimic predefined actions. The tasks involve:

1. Displaying a series of simple movements (e.g., raising arms, touching toes) on a screen.
2. Using pose estimation algorithms (e.g., OpenPose, HRNet) to capture joint trajectories and compare them against predefined movement templates.
3. Extracting features such as joint angles, motion smoothness, and synchronization to determine developmental benchmarks.

## Task 2: Testing Coordination through Standing Long Jump

Coordination is assessed via the standing long jump test, where children perform a jump, and key metrics are extracted:

1. Leveraging pose estimation to track joint movements during take-off, flight, and landing phases.
2. Calculating parameters such as take-off angle, limb synchronization, and balance upon landing.
3. Employing a custom metric to score overall coordination based on CV-derived features.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Mimicry Action Benchmarking

**Objective:** Validate the system’s accuracy in detecting and analyzing mimicry tasks.

**Method:**

- Use open-source datasets (e.g., COCO Keypoints Dataset, MPII Dataset) to simulate mimicry tasks.
- Predefine movements based on dataset annotations and validate the model's ability to measure accuracy in joint alignment and motion patterns.

**Metrics:**

- Joint angle deviation.
- Motion smoothness (measured using jerk minimization techniques).
- **Movement Stability Index (MSI):** Quantifies the stability of joint movements by analyzing the trajectory variance and body center-of-mass deviation during mimicry tasks.

### Experiment 2: Coordination Assessment via Long Jump

**Objective:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the system in detecting coordination anomalies.

**Method:**

- Use open-source datasets such as NTU RGB+D Dataset to train models for analyzing standing long jump sequences.
- Validate model predictions against simulated cases of normal and impaired coordination.

**Metrics:**

- Jump distance prediction accuracy.
- Take-off and landing balance analysis.
- Classification precision for coordination levels.
- **Dynamic Coordination Ratio (DCR):** Measures the synchronization of limb movements during take-off and flight phases by analyzing temporal joint correlations.

### Experiment 3: Longitudinal Development Analysis

**Objective:** Examine the feasibility of using the CV system for long-term developmental tracking.

**Method:**

- Simulate longitudinal data by segmenting existing datasets into temporal sequences.
- Use temporal modeling (e.g., recurrent neural networks) to analyze developmental trends.
- Validate model predictions against artificially generated developmental trajectories.

**Metrics:**

- Consistency of CV-derived metrics over time.
- Predictive accuracy for identifying developmental delays.
- Model robustness in simulated long-term scenarios.
- **Consistency over Time (CoT):** Evaluates whether CV-derived metrics remain stable across multiple trials over time.
- **Pose Reconstruction Error (PRE):** Assesses the accuracy of the 2D pose estimation by comparing reconstructed 3D poses to ground truth annotations.

## Implementation Framework

1. **Data Collection:** Use open-source datasets (e.g., COCO, MPII, NTU RGB+D) to train and validate models.
2. **Model Training:** Fine-tune pre-trained CV models (e.g., Mediapipe, YOLO) on open-source data.
3. **Evaluation:** Employ cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability.
4. **Feedback Integration:** Iteratively refine the system based on feedback from domain experts.

## Ethical Considerations

- Ensure data usage complies with open-source licensing agreements.
- Avoid collecting any new data involving minors directly.
- Focus exclusively on synthetic or publicly available datasets to maintain ethical boundaries.

This methodology combines robust CV techniques with domain-specific expertise to provide actionable insights into children’s physical development and coordination, with a focus on innovative evaluation metrics for performance comparison.
