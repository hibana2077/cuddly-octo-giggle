# Methodology

## Overview

This study employs computer vision (CV) techniques to assess children's physical development and coordination through structured tasks. The proposed methodology integrates action recognition, pose estimation, and temporal analysis to evaluate children's performance in specific movement-based tests. The system leverages machine learning models trained on open-source datasets to ensure accurate and reliable assessments.

## Task 1: Assessing Limb Development via Imitation

We aim to evaluate children's limb development by analyzing their ability to mimic predefined actions. The tasks involve:

1. Displaying a series of simple movements (e.g., raising arms, touching toes) on a screen.
2. Using pose estimation algorithms (e.g., OpenPose, HRNet) to capture joint trajectories and compare them against predefined movement templates.
3. Extracting features such as joint angles, motion smoothness, and synchronization to determine developmental benchmarks.

## Task 2: Testing Coordination through Standing Long Jump

Coordination is assessed via the standing long jump test, where children perform a jump, and key metrics are extracted:

1. Leveraging pose estimation to track joint movements during take-off, flight, and landing phases.
2. Calculating parameters such as take-off angle, limb synchronization, and balance upon landing.
3. Employing a custom metric to score overall coordination based on CV-derived features.

## Experiments

### Experiment 1: Mimicry Action Benchmarking

**Objective:** Validate the system’s accuracy in detecting and analyzing mimicry tasks.

**Method:**

- Use open-source datasets (e.g., COCO Keypoints Dataset, MPII Dataset) to simulate mimicry tasks.
- Predefine movements based on dataset annotations and validate the model's ability to measure accuracy in joint alignment and motion patterns.

**Metrics:**

- Joint angle deviation.
- Motion smoothness (measured using jerk minimization techniques).
- **Movement Stability Index (MSI):** Quantifies the stability of joint movements by analyzing the trajectory variance and body center-of-mass deviation during mimicry tasks.

### Experiment 2: Coordination Assessment via Long Jump

**Objective:** Develop and validate innovative metrics to evaluate coordination and stability in standing long jump sequences among young children, with a focus on motion interpretability and practical applications in physical education and developmental studies.

**Method:**

- Use self-generated datasets comprising "normal" and "abnormal" standing long jump videos from young children to simulate real-world scenarios.
- Extract skeleton data using state-of-the-art pose estimation tools (e.g., Mediapipe, OpenPose).
- Apply proposed metrics to assess coordination and stability in both normal and abnormal cases.
- Supplement analysis by comparing results to existing motion analysis methods.

**Metrics:**

#### Existing Metrics:

1. **Dynamic Coordination Ratio (DCR)**: Measures synchronization of limb movements during take-off and flight phases by analyzing temporal joint correlations.

#### New Metrics:

1. **Limb Movement Trajectory Smoothness**:
   - **Characteristic:** Quantifies the smoothness of limb movements by evaluating jerk (rate of change of acceleration) and trajectory variance. Smoother trajectories indicate better coordination.

2. **Landing Stability Index (LSI)**:
   - **Characteristic:** Evaluates landing stability by analyzing deviations in the center-of-mass and joint positions upon landing, along with oscillations in postural stability. High values indicate poor stability.

**Focus on Young Children:**
This study exclusively targets young children to explore the developmental aspects of coordination and stability. The metrics are tailored to detect subtle differences in motor skill development, providing actionable insights for educators and caregivers. Emphasis is placed on ethical data collection and practical applications within educational and developmental settings.

## Implementation Framework

1. **Data Collection:** Use open-source datasets (e.g., COCO, MPII, NTU RGB+D) to train and validate models.
2. **Model Training:** Fine-tune pre-trained CV models (e.g., Mediapipe, YOLO) on open-source data.
3. **Evaluation:** Employ cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability.
4. **Feedback Integration:** Iteratively refine the system based on feedback from domain experts.

## Ethical Considerations

- Ensure data usage complies with open-source licensing agreements.
- Avoid collecting any new data involving minors directly.
- Focus exclusively on synthetic or publicly available datasets to maintain ethical boundaries.

This methodology combines robust CV techniques with domain-specific expertise to provide actionable insights into children’s physical development and coordination, with a focus on innovative evaluation metrics for performance comparison.
